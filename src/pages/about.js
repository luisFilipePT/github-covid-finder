            It would be great if any software engineer with spare time can just
            peruse open Github issues across all OpenAir [Covid-19] projects, filter for
            their area of expertise and just submit little PRs within their
            specific time constraints. You shouldnâ€™t even need to engage too
            deeply with the wider project organisation; just see a list of
            valuable quickwins that you can tackle rapidly to add value to any
            team that needs it."
